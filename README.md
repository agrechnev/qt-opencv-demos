Minimal Qt6 + OpenCV (C++) examples
====================

Here I present 3 minimal examples of combining Qt6 Widgets with OpenCV in C++.

This is a CMake project, tested on Kubuntu 23.10 (in November 2023).

Important: This is strictly Qt6, the Multimedia API changed a lot in Qt6, my old Qt5 examples are here:

* `fun1`: Play a video file with Qt, convert each frame to `cv::Mat`  
* `fun2`: Load an image with OpenCV, display it with Qt  
* `fun3`:  Play a video file with Qt, convert each frame to `cv::Mat`, and display it with Qt
